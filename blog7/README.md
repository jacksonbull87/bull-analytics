<img align="center" width="1000" height="700" src="https://github.com/jacksonbull87/bull-analytics/blob/main/blog7/visuals/track_age.jpeg">

- 11% of tracks have been on the Top 100 chart for 2 months
- 57% of the tracks have been on the chart for over 2 months
- 30% of the tracks have been on the chart for less than a month

Since this is a discovery tool, we're only concerned with the newest records. So the next step would be to filter this dataset down to artists who have only been on this chart for a month.
